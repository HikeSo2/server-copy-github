Server Cloner is a simple `python` app that lets you easily clone other Discord servers by pasting the server / guild ID into this program. The bot will do everything else for you. This can be ran on a bot account (recommended way) or if the bot is not on the server you want to clone, you can use a user token.

### Setup
To use this, you will need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 8 or higher. When installed, run `start`. This will install all required dependencies.
Now you want to place your bot/user token in the program when saying: `[>]  Token:`. Once you've done that, you can proceed on what the program tells you to do.

### What does it clone?
This program clones:

Roles
Permission Overwrites in channels
Voice channels
Text channels
Categories
Emojis

### Prerequisites
- If you are going to run this on a bot account, make sure it is on less than 10 servers as Discord only allows server creation for bots that are in less than 10 guilds.
- If you decide to use a user token, do note that Discord might terminate your account
